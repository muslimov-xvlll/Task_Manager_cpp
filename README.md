# Task Manager — Console Application (C++)

## 📌 Description
Task Manager is a console-based application written in C++ that allows users to manage tasks through a simple and intuitive ASCII interface.  
The program supports creating, editing, deleting, sorting and filtering tasks, as well as saving and loading them from a file.

The project demonstrates practical experience with **C++ OOP**, **file I/O**, **data structures**, **input validation**, and building a clean, user-friendly CLI interface.
